# Health-Management-System


The Syracuse university health services is a 24x7 organization of its own. It provides a variety of services to the university students and also to the Syracuse community. They provide general healthcare services, immunization services, advanced diagnostics and also recommend doctors for better treatment.SU health services is the go-to place for medical and emergency services for students and professors.
SU health also regularly conducts awareness campaigns and provides free health services such as flu shots to students. They have connections with a number of doctors and hospitals in the NY state and can recommend students to specific health treatment plans. They have highly qualified doctors, nurses who are experienced in providing high quality healthcare.
The Current system captures the student personal details and immunization records. But this information alone is insufficient to make a difference in the way the medicines are prescribed. By knowing the medical history of students from the Crouse Hospital and medicine records from CVS Health, better medicines can be prescribed specific to that particular patient. 

Description:
The SUID card can be used as a universal barcode for Syracuse students. It contains all the required personal details of the students. 

SU Medical Health
- The student calls or visits the health services for appointment.
- The admin then uses the SUID card to place an appointment. The registration and student details are automatically updated in the existing system.
- The admin reserves the right to cancel or update the appointment at any time.
- The student also check his appointment details at health services

System to be implemented 

At Crouse
- Crouse is a super-specialty hospital located on campus and is the first hospital of preference for Syracuse university students.
- Students go to Crouse for simple ailments such as cold, fever as well as for surgeries.
- Crouse uses a normal patient management system which records the patientâ€™s profile as well as treatment and diagnostic history at Crouse.
- Since Crouse is a private entity, it is open to all public. The new system proposes to migrate the existing student details in their database into a new system which will use SUID for Syracuse students to enter their details into the database. The university can coordinate with Crouse to build this database.

At CVS
- CVS is the primary drug store located on campus. Most Syracuse university students buy drugs from CVS
- CVS maintains a transaction management system and they do not maintain the drug history of their customers
- The university can coordinate with CVS Health to build a database system, where the pharmacists can ask SU students to use their ID card while buying drugs, so that their drug history can be recorded into the system.
